 <h1>rwnio</h1>

_rwnio is a program in terminal to talk in chat rooms with your friends, you can both create and join one, these rooms stay for a week and then disappear, if everyone leaves they can re-enter using the hash_

_you can set your name when you launch the program, as well as change it once inside, which is persistent locally on your computer, the only information you need is a nickname and it is optional, the messages become invisible after 2s of typing but STILL there to be sent, enjoy rwnio_
